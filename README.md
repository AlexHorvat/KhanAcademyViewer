Khan Academy Viewer
=================

A Gnome 3 desktop player for Khan Academy videos.

<i>Why choose this over the website?</i>
<ul>
<li>Download videos and watch them offline</li>
<li>Bookmark where you were up to</li>
<li>Continuous play of the entire subject</li>
<li>Easier to browse to a subject (in my opinion at least)</li>
</ul>
